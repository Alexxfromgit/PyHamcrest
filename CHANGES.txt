== Version 1.3 == *IN PROGRESS*

* PyHamcrest is now compatible with Python 3! To install PyHamcrest on Python 3:
  - Install the "distribute" package, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
  - Run "python3 setup.py install"
  Unit tests are not converted by the install procedure. Run "2to3 -nw ." separately to convert them.
  Many thanks to falsetru for this contribution.

* Fixed "described_as" to use its nested matcher to generate the mismatch diagnosis.

* Changed BaseDescription to describe None as "None" instead of "<None>".

* Changed "same_instance" description and mismatch description to be more readable and show the respective memory addresses.


== Version 1.2.1 ==

04 Jan 2011
* Fixed assert_that to describe the diagnosis of the mismatch, not just the mismatched value. PyHamcrest will now give even more useful information.

* Expanded BaseDescription.append_description_of to handle all types of values, not just self-describing values.

* Deprecated:
 - Description.append_value no longer needed; call append_description_of instead.
 - BaseDescription.append_value_list no longer needed; call append_list instead.
 - SelfDescribingValue no longer needed.
